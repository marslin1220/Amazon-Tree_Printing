### Question ###

Tree Printing [Data Structures]

You are given a binary tree where each node contains an integer. Print the tree out to the console level by level, with each level on its own line and each nodeâ€™s value separated by a space. You may assume that the tree is non-empty, but not necessarily sorted, balanced, or complete. You may use the JDK or the standard template library. Your solution will be evaluated on correctness, runtime complexity (big-O), and adherence to coding best practices.  A complete answer will include the following:

1.      Document your assumptions
2.      Explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem
3.      Provide code comments where applicable
4.      Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer.
5.      Provide Test Cases

Example input:
```
    5
   / \
  3   1
 /   / \
9   4   5
   /
  2
```

Example output:
```
5
3 1
9 4 5
2
```

You can use one of the following code skeletons for your solution, or feel free to use the language of your choice from the above list.  

Java:
```java
public class Node {
  public int value;
  public Node left;
  public Node right;
}

void printTree(Node root) {

}
```
C++:
```c++
typedef struct tnode {
  int value;
  struct tnode* left;
  struct tnode* right;
} Node;

void printTree (Node* root) {

}
```
